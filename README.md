# Titanic Data Analysis & Visualization Project

## Overview
This project explores the Titanic dataset, aiming to derive insights related to passenger survival based on various factors. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploration, visualization using Python, SQL queries, and interactive dashboards created with Tableau.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Folder containing the Titanic dataset (CSV file).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebook with Python code for data analysis.
- `tableau/`: Tableau Workbook (.twbx) file for interactive dashboards.

## Tools and Languages Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQL
- Tableau

## Steps

### 1. Data Collection
- Used the Titanic dataset from Kaggle, available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

### 2. Data Cleaning and Exploration (Python)
- Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
- Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.
- Explored basic statistics of the dataset.
- Created visualizations for age distribution, survival by gender, survival by class, and distribution of fares.

### 3. Data Analysis (SQL)
- Executed SQL queries to calculate overall survival rate.
- Analyzed survival rates by gender, class, age group, and fare.

### 4. Data Visualization (Tableau)
- https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/.a.da.balc./viz/TitanicBook_16999856173930/TitanicDashboard?publish=yes
- Connected to the dataset in Tableau.
- Explored data visually using sheets.
- Created dashboards to showcase survival rates by gender, class, and age group.
- Added interactivity features in Tableau.

## Results
- Overall survival rate: [Result]
- Survival rates by gender, class, age group, and fare: [Detailed Results]
