# Objectives:

1) Survival Prediction:
- Build a predictive model to estimate the likelihood of survival for passengers based on available features.

2) Demographic Analysis:
- Explore the demographic composition of passengers, such as age distribution, gender ratio, and class distribution.

3) Family Relationships:
- Investigate the presence of family members aboard. How many families were there? Were family members more likely to survive together?

4) Fare and Class Analysis:
- Analyze the relationship between passenger class, ticket fare, and survival rates.

# Insights to Gain:

1) Survival Factors:
- Identify key factors that contributed to survival. Are there specific demographics or socio-economic factors that correlate with a higher chance of survival?

2) Impact of Class:
- Understand how the socio-economic class of passengers influenced survival rates.

3) Age and Gender Analysis:
- Explore whether age and gender played a significant role in survival outcomes.

4) Family Survival Patterns:
- Examine whether traveling with family members had an impact on survival.

# Questions to Answer:

1) What was the overall survival rate among passengers?
- You can calculate and visualize the overall survival rate.

2) How did survival rates differ between genders?
- The code already includes a visualization of survival counts by gender, but you might want to calculate and display the survival rates for each gender.

3) Were passengers in higher classes more likely to survive?
- You can explore survival rates based on passenger class and visualize the findings.

4) Did the age of passengers influence their chances of survival?
- The code includes a basic visualization of the age distribution, but you might want to analyze survival rates across different age groups.

5) What insights can be drawn from the distribution of fares?
- You can explore the distribution of fares and analyze whether there's a correlation between fare and survival.
