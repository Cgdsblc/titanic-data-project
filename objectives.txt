# Objectives:

1) Survival Prediction:
- Build a predictive model to estimate the likelihood of survival for passengers based on available features.

2) Demographic Analysis:
- Explore the demographic composition of passengers, such as age distribution, gender ratio, and class distribution.

3) Fare and Class Analysis:
- Analyze the relationship between passenger class, ticket fare, and survival rates.


# Insights to Gain:

1) Survival Factors:
- Identify key factors that contributed to survival. Are there specific demographics or socio-economic factors that correlate with a higher chance of survival?

2) Impact of Class:
- Understand how the socio-economic class of passengers influenced survival rates.

3) Age and Gender Analysis:
- Explore whether age and gender played a significant role in survival outcomes.


# Questions to Answer:

1) What was the overall survival rate among passengers?
- I calculated and visualized the overall survival rate.

2) How did survival rates differ between genders?
- I calculated and displayed the survival rates for each gender.

3) Were passengers in higher classes more likely to survive?
- I explored survival rates based on passenger class and visualized the findings.

4) Did the age of passengers influence their chances of survival?
- I analyzed survival rates across different age groups.

5) What insights can be drawn from the distribution of fares?
- I explored the distribution of fares and analyzed the correlation between fare and survival.
